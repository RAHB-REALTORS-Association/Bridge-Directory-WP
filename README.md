- **Infinite Scroll**: Offices are loaded automatically as users scroll, enhancing the user experience without traditional pagination.
- **Automated Data Sync**: Full and incremental synchronization with the Bridge Interactive API to keep office data current, including handling of inactive records.
- **Custom Database Storage**: Utilizes a custom WordPress database table for efficient storage and retrieval, optimized for large datasets.
- **User-Friendly Admin Interface**: Intuitive settings page for configuring API access, synchronization intervals, and managing data directly from the WordPress admin dashboard.

## Benefits

### For Website Visitors

- **Enhanced User Experience**: Easily find and contact the nearest office with an intuitive and responsive interface.
- **Quick Access to Information**: Advanced search functionality reduces the time needed to locate specific offices.

### For Administrators

- **Operational Efficiency**: Automates the updating of office information, reducing manual workload and minimizing errors.
- **Accurate Data**: Ensures the directory reflects the most current office statuses and details.
- **Scalable Solution**: Designed to handle growth as more offices are added without significant redevelopment.

## Installation

1. **Install Plugin**:
   - **Option A**: Download the latest plugin zip file from the [Releases](releases/) Page and install it through the WordPress `Plugins -> Add New Plugin` screen directly.
   - **Option B**: Upload the `bridge-directory` folder from the repository to the `/wp-content/plugins` directory on your WordPress installation, then install the dependencies (see Development Setup below).
2. **Activate Plugin**: Activate the plugin through the `Plugins -> Installed Plugins` screen in WordPress.

### Development Setup

If you chose Option B and are setting up the plugin for development purposes, from the `bridge-directory` folder:

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Run `composer install` to set up autoloading.
   - Run `npm install` to install Node.js dependencies.
   - Run `npm run build` to build the block editor scripts.

## Usage

1. **Configure Plugin Settings**:
   - Navigate to `Settings -> Bridge Directory` in the WordPress admin dashboard.
   - **Access Token**: Enter your Bridge Data Output API access token.
   - **Dataset Name**: Specify the dataset name to query (e.g., `itso`).
   - **Sync Interval**: Set how often (in hours) to perform incremental syncs. Default is every 24 hours.
   - **Advanced Query Filter**: (Optional) Add additional query parameters for API requests. Do not include `OfficeStatus` in this field. Separate multiple parameters with `&`.
2. **Data Synchronization**:
   - Click the **Full Sync** button to initiate the initial data synchronization.
